Our goal is to evaluate linear regression, its regularized variant and the Bayesian model including model selection. In all your experiments we are reporting the performance in-terms of the mean square error
Task1: Comparing the Bayesian algorithm to Linear Regression with and without Regularization
Task 2: Bayesian Model Selection for Parameters and Model Order


Steps to execute the code:
Copy the code (either the jupyter source file or the python file as both are the same) in any environment where jupyter or python file processing application is available.
place the data folder(pp2data) with all the data files under the current directory where the code is copied
The code has been created as separate cells and needs to be executed either all or in the order from top to bottom if jupyter is used.
